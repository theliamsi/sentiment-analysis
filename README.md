# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This project implements a **sentiment classifier** for movie reviews using a **from-scratch Logistic Regression model** in Python. The dataset used is the [IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 25,000 training reviews and 25,000 test reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Project Overview

### Data Loading
The IMDB dataset is stored in folders such as:
'train/ pos/.txt neg/.txt test/ pos/.txt neg/.txt'


Each `.txt` file contains a single review.

### Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing
- (Optionally) removing punctuation/numbers or performing tokenization

### Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF** is used to convert text into numerical feature vectors.

### Logistic Regression (From Scratch)
- **Gradient Descent** updates the model parameters.
- Predictions are generated by applying the **sigmoid** function and a threshold (default 0.5).

### Evaluation
- **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**
- Visualization of **top positive/negative words** by examining logistic regression coefficients
- **Confusion matrix** to see distribution of predictions
